## Abstract
In recent years, blockchain has received increasing attention and numerous applications have emerged from this technology. A renowned blockchain application is the cryptocurrency bitcoin, that has not only been effectively solving the double-spending problem but also it can confirm the legitimacy of transactional records without relying on a centralized system to do so. Therefore, any application using blockchain technology as the base architecture ensures that the contents of its data are tamper-proof. This project uses the ***Decentralized Blockchain Technology*** approach to ensure that consumers do not fully rely on the merchants to determine if products are genuine. The project describes a decentralized blockchain system with products anti-counterfeiting, in that way manufacturers can use this system to provide genuine products without having to manage direct-operated stores, which can significantly reduce the cost of product quality assurance.

## Motivation
The trade in counterfeit goods is growing and is affecting the sales and profits of companies affected by this phenomenon. To ensure the identification and traceability of real products throughout the supply chain, this project is the first to propose a fully functional blockchain system to prevent product counterfeiting. Nowadays, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often have financial burdens, which cannot be compared with large companies with strong financial resources. In this project, a blockchain architecture provided by Ethereum is used to record product ownership on the blockchain. By using blockchain's untraceability and ***transparency*** properties, and the assurance that each record cannot be forged on the blockchain, consumers donâ€™t need to fully rely on trusted third parties to safely know the source of the purchased product.

## Problem Statement
- There are various tricky parts here in detecting whether the product is fake or real. It is very scary to hear this happening with medicines and kids' toys. This problem is becoming more serious as the product's value will be questioned.
- The worldwide improvement of an item or innovation consistently accompanies hazard factors, for example, forging and duplication. Forging items can affect the company's name and the client's wellbeing.
- Presently days, discovery of phony products is the greatest test. Fake products are causing a significant impact on the company and the client's wellbeing. Hence, item creators are facing enormous losses.

## Proposed Solution
- Through this project, we plan to implement a blockchain system architecture to record ownership of the product in the Blockchain network. Two very important properties of blockchain are untraceability and transparency. This fast system also makes the data error-free.
- India and different nations are battling such fake and counterfeit products. In the proposed framework, it generates QR codes utilizing blockchain innovation. This innovation stores transaction records in blocks. These blocks are secure and difficult to access and change the data from. By utilizing a QR code we can recognize the fake item.

## Objectives
- To design an anti-counterfeit system using blockchain.
- To secure product details using a QR code.
- Provide security to the clients by offering data to clients.
- The immutable characteristic of the blockchain provides more security and transparency in the transactions of the proposed system.
- To stop the making of fake products by conducting transparency about the products to the notice of the consumers.
- To become aware of fake products from the primary product available in the marketplace and to enhance this performance.
